        <item>Google announced Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) at the Google I/O conference on June 27, 2012. Based on Linux kernel 3.0.31, Jelly Bean was an incremental update with the primary aim of improving the functionality and performance of the user interface. The performance improvement involved Project Butter, which uses touch anticipation, triple buffering, extended vsync timing and a fixed frame rate of 60 fps to create a fluid and "buttery-smooth" UI.[97] Android 4.1 Jelly Bean was released to the Android Open Source Project on July 9, 2012,[98] and the Nexus 7 tablet, the first device to run Jelly Bean, was released on July 13, 2012.</item>

KitKat debuted on Googles Nexus 5 on October 31, 2013, and was optimized to run on a greater range of devices than earlier Android versions, having 512 MB of RAM as a recommended minimum; those improvements were known as "Project Svelte" internally at Google.</item>
